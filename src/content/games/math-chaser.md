**Math Chaser** is an exhilarating infinite runner that blends fast-paced action with brain-teasing math challenges. Perfect for players of all ages, this game sharpens your reflexes while boosting your math skills in a fun and engaging way. Whether you're a math whiz or just looking to improve, Math Chaser offers a unique experience that will keep you hooked!

### **Game Controls**

The game controls are straightforward—just swipe the screen in the direction you want to go. You can swipe left, right, up to jump, and down to roll.

### **Gameplay Overview**

In Math Chaser, you control a runner racing down a futuristic track. The twist? The track is filled with number-laden boxes and tricky obstacles, and your goal is to collect the right numbers to keep your energy up while avoiding dangers that threaten your progress.

Furthermore, special boxes will spawn equations that need solving. Run into the correct answer that appears on one of the three lanes to solve the equation and advance to the next level. The higher you go, the tougher the equations get! But be careful—choosing the wrong answer will drain your energy.

### **Game Modes**

Math Chaser features multiple modes to challenge and entertain:

- **All Numbers Mode**: Collect any number box to restore your energy as you run. The challenge lies in maintaining your energy while dodging various obstacles.
- **Odd Numbers Mode**: Only collect boxes with odd numbers. Grabbing an even number will cost you a life, so stay sharp and focused!
- **Even Numbers Mode**: Just like Odd Numbers Mode, but in reverse. Collect even numbers only and steer clear of odd ones to keep your run going.
- **Custom Number Mode**: The game randomly selects five numbers, and your task is to collect only those numbers. It's a test of both memory and speed.

### **Obstacles and Enemies**

Math Chaser isn't just about numbers; you'll also need to outmaneuver various threats:

- **Tesla Line**: An electrified barrier that spans the track. Dodge it quickly to avoid taking damage.
- **Tornadoes**: Swirling vortexes that move unpredictably. Avoid them at all costs to keep your run going.
- **Space Bandit**: A formidable enemy that fires projectiles at you. Stay on your toes and dodge to survive!

### **Difficulty Progression**

As you advance in Math Chaser, the game ramps up the difficulty with more complex equations and trickier obstacles. Can you keep up the pace and solve the math challenges under pressure?

### **Educational Value**

Math Chaser isn’t just a game—it’s also a powerful learning tool. Each mode is designed to reinforce key math concepts like number recognition, odd/even differentiation, and basic arithmetic. Whether you're a student looking to sharpen your skills or an adult wanting to keep your mind sharp, Math Chaser offers a fun and interactive way to practice math.
