**Wobble Trouble** is a fast-paced action game where you control a wobbly character in thrilling arena battles. Swipe, aim, and release to send your character flying through the arena, dealing damage to enemies and dodging powerful attacks. With its unique control mechanics and engaging gameplay, Wobble Trouble offers a fresh and exciting experience for players of all skill levels.

### **Game Controls**

The controls are easy to learn—simply swipe to aim and release to send your character in motion. Hold your swipe longer to charge up your power and deal more damage when you hit enemies.

### **Gameplay Overview**

In Wobble Trouble, the arena is your battlefield! The goal is to master your wobble movements, timing your attacks perfectly to damage enemies while avoiding incoming threats. The more precise your strikes, the more effective your attacks will be. Collect power-ups to boost your abilities and stay one step ahead of your foes.

### **Game Modes**

Wobble Trouble offers three distinct game modes to keep you entertained and challenged:

- **Destroy All Enemies Mode**: Clear the arena of all enemies to complete each round and advance to the next level. With each round, enemies become tougher and appear in new formations, keeping you on your toes.
- **Survival Mode**: Test your endurance by surviving an onslaught of enemies for a specific time limit. New enemies spawn continuously, and your goal is to stay alive for as long as possible.
- **Defeat the Boss Mode**: Take on powerful bosses in intense one-on-one battles. Learn their attack patterns, find their weaknesses, and strike when the time is right!

### **Enemies and Bosses**

Battle a variety of enemies, each with its own unique abilities and behavior:

- **Enemy Wobbler**: A dangerous foe that charges aggressively at you. Dodge its charges and strike back when you see an opening.
- **Evil Mage**: Beware of the dark spells this enemy hurls your way. Stay alert and maneuver carefully to avoid getting hit.
- **Orc**: A powerful enemy that uses wide swiping strikes. Time your attacks to strike when it’s vulnerable.
- **Turret Robot**: Avoid volleys of projectiles from this stationary enemy and close in for the kill.
- **Tiny Dragon**: A small but deadly enemy that breathes fireballs. Use your agility to dodge its fiery breath.
- **Skeletons**: This enemy can teleport close to you, catching you off-guard if you’re not careful.

Face off against two epic bosses that bring unique challenges:

- **Golemik**: A massive golem that uses various spells to control the battlefield. The only way to weaken it is by defeating four golem spirits that appear in the corners of the arena.
- **Red**: A giant spider that creates poison clouds and shoots poison projectiles. Defeat its minions to weaken it, and strike when it’s vulnerable.
