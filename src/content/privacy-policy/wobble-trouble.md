### **Information We Collect**

Wobble Trouble does not directly collect personal or non-personal information. However, third-party services integrated into the game, such as Google AdMob, may collect data such as device ID and coarse location to provide targeted advertisements. Please refer to the third-party service's privacy policies for details on the types of data collected.

### **Google AdMob Integration**

Wobble Trouble uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. These ads may collect certain information about your device, including but not limited to your IP address, device identifier, coarse location, and interaction with advertisements. The data is used to display targeted ads based on your interests and interaction patterns. You can opt out of personalized ads by following the instructions provided by Google in their privacy policy.

### **App Tracking Transparency**

On iOS devices, Wobble Trouble respects the App Tracking Transparency framework. When you launch the game for the first time, you will see a prompt asking for your permission to track your activity across other apps and websites. If you choose not to allow tracking, personalized ads will not be shown. You can change this preference at any time in your device settings.

### **Local Storage of In-Game Progress**

Wobble Trouble saves your game progress and high scores locally on your device. This data is not transmitted or shared with any third parties. If you uninstall the app or clear its data, your progress will be lost.

### **User Rights**

You have the right to opt out of personalized ads and tracking at any time. For iOS devices, go to your device's settings and select **Privacy > Tracking** to update your preferences. For more information on Google AdMob's data collection and your options, please visit Google's privacy policy.

### **Compliance with Laws**

Wobble Trouble is committed to complying with privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. The app adheres to these regulations through its third-party service providers like Google AdMob, which handle data collection and processing.
